# ✈️🥖 **Flight of the Toasters** 🥳🎉

![The "smaller" version](image.png)

This started out as a "simple" project to create a fun way to display the health of my homelab server. 🏡💻 I ended up spending so much time on the looks of it that I decided to make a generic version. 🎨✨ One that didn't rely on inputs from a server and could be used by anyone. 🙌 So here we are. The flying toasters are back! 🚀🍞

Here's the demos (Don't forget to click UnMute on the page! 🔊):

  - My homelab server health depicted by flying toasters. 🏡💻
- https://flyingk8s.milagrofrost.com/?configFile=smaller
  - More traditional flying toasters. 🍞🕊️

  - These guys need to tone down their caffeine intake. ☕🍞🕊️

  - If every one is a cop, then no one is a cop. 🚓🍞🕊️

  - Christmas mode with snowfall, festive gifs, no labels, and no police sounds! ❄️🎄


## ✨ **Features** ✨

- 🧭 **Taking a new direction.**
  - Yes, the OG flying toasters are from right to left. 🕰️➡️ These ones are going from left to right. ⬅️⏳ I was already more than halfway through working on animations and images when I realized that I was going the wrong way. 🔄 Or is it? 🤔 Maybe you're crazy and I'm not. 🤪 You need to get yourself checked out. 🏥🩺
- 🚔 **Cops and robbers**
  - Some of these toasts are zooming by faster than others. 🏎️💨 And some are smuggling large portions of butter. 🧈😱 The Butter Police 🚨🧑‍✈️ are on the lookout for these toasts. They will chase them down and take them out. 🚓💥 The Butter Police are not to be trifled with. 😤👊
  - 👮‍♂️🔊 Cops have audio if you choose to unmute the page. 🎧 Are these audio clips from Road Rash 64? 🏍️🎶 Could be.
  - 🔎 You might hear the audio sometimes but not see the cop. That's because the cop is off-screen. 📡🚫 Or they're cop ninjas. 🥷🚓 Something like that.
  - Lore? https://flyingk8s.milagrofrost.com/cops_and_robbers.mp3
- 🍞 **Toast levels**
  - The toasts have 4 levels of toast. 🔢 None, just right, crispy, and burnt. 🔥 AI images. 🖼️🤖
- 🔥 **Toaster levels**
  - The toasters have 4 levels of toasting. 🔢 Off, warm, hot, and on fire. 🔥🔥
- 📏 **Toast and toaster sizes may vary**
  - Add some variety to the toasts and toasters. 📐🎨 
- 👼 **Biblically accurate wings**
  - Do the wings look silly? 😂 Yes, but that's what God intended. 🙏 Even their "odd" flapping patterns are actually totally normal. 🕊️ I'm not sure what you're talking about. 🤷‍♂️
- 💤 **Some toasts pause in the middle of the screen**
  - They're just taking a break. 🛌 They'll get back to flying soon enough. 🕺 Totally meant to do that. 😏
- 🖥️ **Built for large resolution screens**
  - The toasts are flying in 4K. 🏞️ They're not going to be flying in 1080p. That's for plebs. 😜 You can scale the toast and toaster sizes to your liking by updating the `config.json` file. 🛠️📜
- 🏎️ **The faster they fly, the more likely they will render funny**
  - 🕊️ Wings will be separated from the toasters. 🍞🧈 Butter won't be on the toast.
  - 🏆 Toaster or toasts set too small will also do the same.
- 🌐 **Toasters are generated based on values from a remote data source or using the fallback data source `local-fallback.json`.**
- 🥳 **The first few toasts will not have any butter on them or be police.**
  - It just does that. It's a feature. 😏 We're in the features section BTW.
- ❄️ **Christmas mode**
  - Snowfall effect, festive gifs for toasters and toasts, Santa appears larger and less frequently, no labels or police sounds. 🎄❄️

## 🎮 **Select Modes** 🎮

- You can change how the toasters are generated by adding to the URL of the site:
  - https://URL/?configFile=smaller
- I have several modes you can select from:
  - [arbysconvention](public/configs/arbysconvention.json)
  - [calm](public/configs/calm.json)
  - [christmas](public/configs/christmas.json)
  - [crazytoasters](public/configs/crazytoasters.json)
  - [default](public/configs/default.json)
  - [mayhem](public/configs/mayhem.json)
  - [orderly](public/configs/orderly.json)
  - [policestate](public/configs/policestate.json)
  - [smaller](public/configs/smaller.json)
  - [spreadthewealth](public/configs/spreadthewealth.json)
  - [tiny](public/configs/tiny.json)
  - [warpspeed](public/configs/warpspeed.json)


## 📊 **Observability** 📊

- These toasts and toasters can be generated based on K8s metrics. 📈📊
  - https://github.com/milagrofrost/Flying-K8s
- But it doesn't have to be just K8s metrics. 🤯 
  - As long as you follow the same json schema as seen in [public/local-fallback.json](public/local-fallback.json) and adjust the values in [public/configs/default.json](public/configs/default.json) to what makes sense for what your metric values, the sky's the limit!

## 🆘 **Need help with** 🆘

- 🧑‍💻 I'm not a React developer. 🤓 ChatGPT did most of the legwork for me. 💪 Plus, I'm a little burnt out. 🥵 So the small fixes are becoming a little more difficult for me to do at the moment. 😓
- 🎯 Getting stuff consistently centered. 🧈🕊️ Butter and wings are a little off sometimes. 🧐 I'm not sure why yet.
- 🤷‍♂️ Wings don't flap in sync. 🕊️🔄
- 🕺 Better wing animation? ✨
- 📚 Better code organization. 🧹 I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. 🤷‍♀️

## 🚀 **Future features?** 🚀

- 🛠️ **Mods!** Changing out the toasters and toasts for other images.
  - 🧱 Minecraft Steves and blocks. 🏗️
  - 🎮 and other pop culture references. 🎥🎵
- 🎨 **Non-AI generated images.** I just wanted to see what it would look like. 🤔 I'm not sure if I like it yet. 🧐
- 📜 **More config files!**



## ⚠️ **Known issues** ⚠️

- 📋 **See features above.** 😅
